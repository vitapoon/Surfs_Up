## Summary

By looking at the results, there is an enjoyable average temperature in two months that are 6 months apart from one another. That shows that for most months of the year, there will be enjoyable temperature for people to come and use the surf shop.
There are two additional queries that we would perform to gather more weather data for June and December. one is the paticipation and the other is the location for visitors to come.
